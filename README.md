### What is Glass?
Glass is an e-commerce website created to mimic a small business. <br>
It allows users to purchase various items, add them to a cart, and pay using Stripe. <br>
Stripe is currently using **test data mode** and so no transactions will actually be sent through (although the checkout page will mimic it)


### What technologies does Glass use?
- **_NextJS_** is used to create the frontend and backend (this is a framework built on top of React)
- **_Sanity_** is used as a CMS to allow users to easily add new items to the website and change the banner
- **_Stripe_** is used to handle payments  
- **_TailwindCSS_** is used to help with building the CSS  

### Moving forward with Glass
Glass is currently in version 1.0 for the production state.<br>
In the future, I have the following improvements:
- Streamline the items being added to follow/mimic a specific business
